# bare-metal-flow

**bare-metal-flow** or **Anvil**, have not settled on a name yet... is a fragment of a fully functioning app, that will eventually become a
fully functioning app.

it is a showcase app targeting recruiters and tech interviewers, but in time, as I add more features it'll turn it into a full
application.

I made also a front end code that will be showcased in videos and screenshots, but it is a licensed template for which I have a professional
use license but not yet a FOSS one.

for the moment the project looks like this:

## bare-metal-flow tech

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

If you want to learn more about Quarkus, please visit its website: https://quarkus.io/ .

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:

```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at http://localhost:8080/q/dev/.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:

```shell script
mvn package
```

It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:

```shell script
mvn package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _über-jar_, is now runnable using
```shell script
java -jar target/*-runner.jar
```

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using:

```shell script
mvn package -Pnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using:

```shell script
mvn package -DskipTests=true -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/bare-metal-flow-1.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling.
